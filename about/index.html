                Hi there, I'm Khoi Minh Truong!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Master of Professional Studies in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, with a strong background in Economics, Business, and Computer Science. My academic journey has taken me from Wabash College, where I <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/news/story/13142">graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics</a> and earned several <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/photo-albums/album/5746/15002">academic honors</a>, to the vibrant academic community here at Cornell.

            </p>
            <p>
                My passion lies in the intersection of economics, data analysis, and strategic decision-making. Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have honed my skills in quantitative analysis and coding, with proficiency in Python, R, and various analytical tools. I am driven by a desire to apply these skills to real-world challenges in the financial sector and contribute to data-driven solutions.
            </p> 
            <p>
                As a graduate student, I have engaged in rigorous coursework that has further deepened my understanding of economics, econometrics, and computational methods. I have also had the privilege of working on <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/news/story/13042">award-winning research projects</a> that explore the dynamics of infectious disease spread and the impact of financial crises on income inequality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to various organizations and projects, from editing newsletters to conducting market research and managing cultural outreach initiatives. I am a firm believer in the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the value of diverse experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, you can find me exploring the beauty of the Ithaca landscape, cycling, and scuba diving. I am also passionate about the stage and have played a crucial role in ensuring <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/news/story/12986">the success of college productions</a>. I once even performed in <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/news/story/11908">Devised Theatre</a>!
