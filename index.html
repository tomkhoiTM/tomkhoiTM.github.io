                            With the increasing importance of captions in driving user engagement on social media platforms,
                            social media users often encounter difficulties in crafting engaging wording,
                            leading to suboptimal post performance. CaptionIQ seeks to alleviate these challenges
                            by offering a user-friendly interface that enables users to generate multiple high-quality captions efficiently.
                            Preliminary testing performance metrics achieved by our algorithms are quite promising,
                            indicating a strong ability to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality captions (0.789 AUC-ROC),
                            coupled with a relatively high level of overall accuracy (0.70) and precision (0.71) in its predictions.
                            CaptionIQ envisions establishing a direct relationship with its users,
                            primarily social media specialists, influencers, and content creators.
                            The tool's scalability and potential profitability make it an attractive investment opportunity,
                            with monetization avenues including subscription models, partnerships with social media management platforms,
                            and sponsored content deals.

                            As the demand for experiential consumption rises,
                            the emergence of do-it-yourself (DIY) chocolate kits offers a unique avenue
                            for consumers to engage in artisanal chocolate-making from the comfort of their homes.
                            Drawing upon the theoretical framework of the experiential advantage in consumption,
                            we aim to understand how the DIY chocolate-making experience fulfills consumers' psychological needs.
                            Through a quantitative-method approach encompassing surveying consumer demographics and
                            conducting choice-based conjoint analysis, our findings accentuated the overarching influence of
                            socio-familial bonding experiences and convenience in driving consumer interest,
                            reflecting broader societal trends towards experiential consumption and convenience-driven purchasing decisions.
                            Key discoveries from clustering algorithm reveals somewhat behaviorally distinct but
                            demographically identical consumer segments.
                            Our discussion provides valuable insights into understanding consumer preferences within
                            the underexplored domain of DIY chocolate kits, offering actionable implications for
                            product refinement and effective marketing strategies, especially for our client Home Chocolat.

                            Modeling the spread of infectious diseases has been an increasingly critical component
                            in understanding and mitigating their impact, especially more so in recent years.
                            The classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model framework has been a powerful tool
                            but with limitations. There has been much debate on the effectiveness of said models,
                            considering the complex, dynamic, and inherently heterogeneous nature of human mobility.
                            Utilizing Python, this study explores the use of scale-free and grid mobility networks
                            and gauges how well they can model compared to other more complex systems and real-world epidemics.
                            Key results show that our simulations perform incredibly well despite their simplicity in inputs.
                            Even with no inherent constraints for mutations on infectivity and mortality,
                            our simulated diseases still evolved to spread more readily and to kill their hosts less often.
                            These findings provide more evidence to the relevance of less I/O-intensive systems in
                            studying epidemic spreads and identifying effective strategies for disease control,
                            particularly in situations where more complex models may not be applicable or compilable.

                            Recent decades have seen the distribution of income affected by multiple factors,
                            especially with the recent financial crisis. This paper analyzes the aftereffects
                            of the 2007‚Äì09 Great Recession on income inequality, in combination with market expectations
                            and macroeconomic factors, across 15 countries. Annual data is collected for the period
                            between 2004 and 2018, from upper-high-, lower-high-, and middle-income economies.
                            Key results provide more evidence to the expected rise in income inequality
                            across all-country income groups. Additionally, rising per-capita income in all panels is
                            expected to translate to the narrowing income gap post-crisis.
                            This paper also notes that expansionary monetary policies can have stabilizing effects on
                            the income gap in all country-income groups involved.

            In fact, for the longest time, I've been experimenting with amateur photography and graphic design, as well as theater.

            In my spare time, I enjoy a mix of activities that help me unwind and stay engaged with my passions.
            I obtained a license to scuba dive in open waters internationally, which allows me to explore underwater ecosystems
            and experience new adventures around the world.

            I also love cycling and regularly biked through city traffic in Vietnam.
            To me, doing so provides me a sense of freedom and a way to unwind and clear my mind after a busy day.

            I should add swimming, playing badminton and embarking on outdoor adventures to that list of my leisure activities as well.
            Just recently in 2023 summer, I trekked through the Grand Canyon on a challenging 21-mile hike with my family.
            It was tiring but also incredibly fun.

            Finally, I recently have started to dabble in playing MMORPG games and have generally enjoyed the experience with friends thus far.
